# Chapter4-Exercise-11
Write a program to find all the prime numbers between 1 and 100.

One way to do this is to write a function that will check if a number is prime (i.e., see if the number can be divided by a prime number smaller then itself) using a vector of primes in order ) so that if the vector is called primes, primes[0]==2, primes[1]==3, primes[2]==5, etc). Then write a loop that goes from 1 to 100, checks each number to see if it’s a prime, and store each prime found in a vector, write another loop that lists the primes you found you might check your result by comparing your vector of prime numbers with primes. Consider 2 for the first prime.    

Purpose and questions 
1. In the question they suggest a way to deal with my issue, “to write a function that will see if the number can be divided by a prime number smaller then itself”, what confuses me a little bit is what is highlighted, how do I go about having my program divide the next value being evaluated by a smaller prime number then itself, knowing that the smaller prime number is relative to what the current value is?
